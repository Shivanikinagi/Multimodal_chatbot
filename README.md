Tasks Overview

Task 1: Extractive Summarization
- Objective: Create concise summaries of longer documents using an extractive summarization technique.  
- Implementation:
   - Used NLP techniques to extract and combine the most important sentences.  
   - Included a Python script and Jupyter Notebook.  
- Outcome:
   - Tool that generates summaries effectively with high accuracy.  

Task 2: Multi-Modal Chatbot
- Objective: Develop a chatbot that can handle both text and image inputs using Google Palm and Gemini AI.  
- Implementation:
   - Integrated NLP models and image processing models.  
   - Created a Python script and Jupyter Notebook.  
- Outcome:
   - Chatbot responds to text and image inputs accurately.  
   - Generates relevant images based on the context of the conversation.  

Task 3: Sentiment Analysis in Chatbot
- Objective: Integrate sentiment analysis into the chatbot to adjust responses based on user emotions.  
- Implementation:
   - Used sentiment analysis models to detect positive, negative, and neutral tones.  
   - Adjusted chatbot responses accordingly.  
- Outcome:
   - Improved chatbot engagement and user satisfaction based on emotional tone.
